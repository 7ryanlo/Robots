# Robots

You're surrounded by killer robots! Your goal is to defeat all robots in the arena, but don't let one touch you (land on same square as you) or else you lose! To attack a robot, you must be next to one and move into that robot. This will cause the robot to be knocked back a square away from you. It takes two hits to kill a robot but only one if the robot is knocked into an arena wall, doing double damage!

Controls: 'u' = up, 'l' = left, 'r' = right, 'd' = down

2D Text-based game created in C++ and must be run in a console.
